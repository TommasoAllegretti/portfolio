Upgrading a Node.js project is often daunting. From deprecated dependencies to compatibility snags and cryptic OpenSSL errors, jumping from an old version to the newest release can trigger a surprising array of headaches. 

Here's a practical guide to the most common issues developers face when upgrading Node.js applications—and how to resolve them with confidence.

---

## OpenSSL Conflicts and Webpack

A frequent breaking point arises when upgrading Node.js to version 17 or later, especially if using Webpack below v5.61.0. 

Starting with Node 17, OpenSSL 3.x replaced the older 1.1.1 version, tightening cryptographic standards and breaking some hashing mechanisms in older Webpack versions. 

This typically leads to:

```bash
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

### Solutions

- **Upgrade Webpack (Recommended)**  
   Update to Webpack v5.61.0 or above. This switch ensures the default hashing algorithm changes from `md4` to `sha256`, fully supported by OpenSSL 3.

- **Use the `openssl-legacy-provider` Flag (Temporary)**  
   As a quick fix, add `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` to your build/start scripts to restore legacy cryptographic support, but note this method is **deprecated** and will eventually disappear in future Node releases.
   
      ```json
      "scripts": {
         "build": "NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider webpack"
      }
      ```

- **Downgrade to Node v16 (Not Recommended)**  
   If updating dependencies isn't possible, using **Node v16** sidesteps the OpenSSL 3 issue. However, Node 16 is now end-of-life and exposes you to unpatched vulnerabilities, so this is a last resort.

## Obsolete Dependencies and Security Vulnerabilities

Node upgrades often expose outdated or deprecated dependencies—many plugins break or are no longer maintained, especially when tied to past Webpack or build system versions. 

Beyond just breaking builds, running Node versions prior to v18 exposes projects to unpatched critical vulnerabilities, with recent CVEs like CVE-2025-23087 explicitly targeting legacy versions.

### Solutions

- **Systematically Update Dependencies**  

   Use [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) to quickly surface outdated packages and interactively upgrade them, grouped by major, minor, and patch changes.

   ```bash
   npm install -g npm-check-updates
   ncu --interactive --format group
   ```

- **Scan for Security Issues**

   Regularly audit your dependencies with `npm audit` and keep watch for CVEs affecting Node runtime versions still in use.
   
- **Refactor or Replace Deprecated Packages**

   Some packages may require full replacement or significant code changes, especially if original maintainers have archived them or if APIs have shifted.

## Removing Unused Dependencies

After upgrading, it's vital to clean out unused dependencies to minimize your attack surface and speed up installs. 

Tools such as [depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck) and [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check) analyze your codebase for unused packages, but treat build-only or devDependencies flagged as unused with caution.

## Unlocking New Features

Modernizing your toolchain doesn't just fix errors—upgraded versions often open up major performance and DX improvements. 

For instance, moving from `babel-loader` to `esbuild-loader` in Webpack 5 delivers drastically faster builds thanks to native ESM and lower-level optimization.

## Converting CommonJS to ESM

Migrating from **CommonJS (CJS)** to **ECMAScript Modules (ESM)** is rapidly becoming essential, as more modern packages are published ESM-only.

- Benefits:

   ESM brings better performance, aligns with browser standards, and encourages cleaner dependency management.

- Migration Process:
   - Add `"type": "module"` to **package.json** to enable ESM mode.
   - Convert `require/module.exports` to `import/export`.
   - Address differences like the lack of `__dirname` in ESM (use shims like `import.meta.url` or `fileURLToPath`).
