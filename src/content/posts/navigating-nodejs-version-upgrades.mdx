Upgrading a Node.js project can feel daunting. From deprecated dependencies to retrocompatibility issues and cryptic OpenSSL error messages, moving from an outdated version to the latest release can introduce a host of problems.  

Today, we'll explore some of the most common challenges developers face when updating their Node.js applications — and how to overcome them.

---

## OpenSSL conflicts

A common pain point occurs when trying to upgrade Node.js to version 17 or higher in projects that use Webpack versions earlier than 5.

In Node.js 17, OpenSSL 3.0 replaced the older OpenSSL 1.1.1, which introduced compatibility issues — especially with Webpack's default hashing algorithms in versions below 5.61.0.

This often results in the following frustrating error message:

```bash
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

If you've seen this before, you know how tricky it can be to troubleshoot.

### Solutions

Here are your main options for resolving this issue:

- **Use the `openssl-legacy-provider` Flag (Not Recommended)**  
   As a temporary workaround, you can enable OpenSSL legacy support. However, this method is deprecated and **will be removed in future Node versions**, so it's not a long-term solution.
   
   In your package.json:

      ```json
      "scripts": {
         "build": "NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider webpack"
      }
      ```

- **Downgrade to Node v16 (Not Recommended)**  
   If updating Webpack isn't feasible and you want stability, reverting to **Node.js v16** avoids the OpenSSL 3.0 issue altogether - but at the cost of staying on an older Node version.

- **Upgrade Webpack (Recommended)**  
   Update Webpack to v5.61.0 or later, where the default hashing algorithm was changed from `md4` to `sha256`, which is fully supported by OpenSSL 3.0.

## Obsolete dependencies

Upgrading Node.js often uncovers issues with **outdated** or **deprecated dependencies**—especially plugins tied to specific versions of tools like Webpack.

Some packages may break or become incompatible, forcing you to find modern replacements that offer similar functionality. Sometimes it's a smooth swap with little code change; other times, especially with unmaintained libraries or custom solutions, it can require deeper **refactoring** to support new APIs or behaviors.

### Solutions

- **Manually update each dependency (Slow)**

- **Helpful tools**  

   One tool that proved invaluable for me is [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates). It scans your `package.json` and detects outdated or deprecated libraries, allowing you to upgrade them easily.

   You can install it with

   ```bash
   npm install npm-check-updates
   ```

   A particularly useful command is

   ```bash
   ncu --interactive --format group
   ```

   This displays all available updates, grouped by **major**, **minor**, and **patch** changes - making it easier to assess the impact of each update before proceeding.

## Performance Enhancing

After upgrading your project's Node version and updating all dependencies to compatible versions, you may reach a point where your project builds correctly and doesn't produce any errors during the build phase or while running in the browser.

This is a great milestone—but there's still room for improvement.

- **Remove any unused dependencies**

  There are several tools that can help detect unused dependencies in your project. The most effective ones are [depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck) and [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check).

   <img className='mx-auto mb-4 border border-solid rounded' alt="npm-check" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/51505/9569919/99c2412a-4f48-11e5-8c65-e9b6530ee991.png"></img>

  These tools analyze your codebase to find references to the dependencies listed in your `package.json`. However, be cautious—some dependencies (like build tools or plugins) are not meant to be directly referenced in your code and may be falsely flagged as unused.

- **Explore new possibilities**

  Updating your bundler, linter, or other core tools can unlock powerful new features that you might not be aware of.

  For example, when migrating from Webpack 4 to 5, I discovered a whole set of new loaders available to transpile my code, and switching from `babel-loader` to `esbuild-loader` reduced my compile time from 35 seconds to about 8 seconds.

- **Convert Your CommonJS Project to ESM**

   Migrating from CommonJS (CJS) to ECMAScript Modules (ESM) is a complex topic worthy of its own series of articles, but in some cases, the transition can be completed in just a few steps. Making this switch enables you to use modern dependencies that are now ESM-only.

  If you dont do this sooner or later you will fall behind with the newest releases and will incur in many weak points and possible vulnerabilities in your codebase.
